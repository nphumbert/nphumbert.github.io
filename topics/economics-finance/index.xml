&lt;p&gt;Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s economy, representing 99% of all businesses and contributing approximately 35% of national GDP (MBIE, 2017). Despite their importance, SMEs face disproportionately tight lending conditions compared to the residential mortgage market. Restricted access to affordable credit limits their ability to invest, expand, and sustain growth, especially for firms employing fewer than 50 people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Balancing Profit and Preservation: Sustainable Strategies for Wildlife Management in South Africa</title><link>https://nadiahl.com/research/sustainable-south-africa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nadiahl.com/research/sustainable-south-africa/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kruger National Park is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest and most biodiverse conservation areas, renowned for its ecological management practices and anti-poaching operations. It attracts millions of visitors each year, contributing significantly to South Africa&amp;rsquo;s tourism economy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unpacking the Housing Affordability Crisis: Structural Drivers and Policy Pathways in New Zealand</title><link>https://nadiahl.com/research/housing-affordability-crisis-nz/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 19:03:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nadiahl.com/research/housing-affordability-crisis-nz/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1990, successive housing booms have pushed New Zealand property prices to levels increasingly out of reach for many aspiring first-time buyers. While existing homeowners have benefited from rising equity, newcomers face a market where the cost of ownership absorbs a disproportionate share of household income. In economic terms, this violates the equimarginal principle, which states that rational agents allocate their limited resources across different needs to maximize overall satisfaction. When housing consumes nearly all disposable income, individuals can no longer balance spending efficiently across other essential goods and services, making homeownership economically unsustainable for many Kiwis.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Incentives, Externalities, and Unintended Consequences: France's Long Dependence on Diesel</title><link>https://nadiahl.com/research/diesel-incentive-france/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2019 19:03:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://nadiahl.com/research/diesel-incentive-france/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After WWII, Charles de Gaulle jump-started the French economy by cutting diesel taxes for the first time, supporting haulers, farmers, and artisans who relied on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, in 1980, Toyota and its revolutionary production model flooded the French market with economical and reliable cars. At the same time, France replaced all its diesel-based power plants with nuclear ones to ensure energy independence. The French government then introduced new diesel incentives to boost the competitive advantage of local manufacturers specializing in diesel engines and to dispose of the million litres of now-useless diesel from power plants.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
