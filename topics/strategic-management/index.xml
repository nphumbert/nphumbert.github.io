&lt;p&gt;When Raj, an British national with ten years of experience in ABC&amp;rsquo;s Indian branch, was promoted to Managing Director of the company&amp;rsquo;s Indonesian subsidiary, he expected his leadership transition to be smooth.

&lt;p&gt;Social entrepreneurship has emerged as a distinctive response to complex social and environmental challenges that traditional business and public institutions have failed to address effectively.
