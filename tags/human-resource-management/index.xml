&lt;p&gt;In 1911, the Norwegian explorer Amundsen won the race to the South Pole, beating the British Scott, who died in the attempt. It was a massive setback for the British, who had dominated the exploration world until then. In an effort to restore their reputation, Sir Ernest Shackleton embarked, alongside 27 other crew members, on the so-called &amp;ldquo;Imperial Trans-Antarctica Expedition&amp;rdquo; (ITAE) in 1915, hoping to cross Antarctica from sea to sea. At the dawn of World War I, this ill-fated expedition put an end to the great era of polar exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
